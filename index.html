        <h2 id=h1>Background</h2>
        <p id="p1">For my first year of college I studied abroad in Valencia, Spain through the First Year Abroad program at Florida State University. People always ask me how it was and for recommendations, so I decided to put together some of my experiences in Valencia. I had so much fun and I hope that I can encourage anyone who sees this to visit Valencia! The picture I am including is across from where I lived. This is a popular destination called "Torres De Serranos" or The Serrano Towers. These towers were used as defense, and also a triumphant arch.</p>

    <div id="Activities">
        <h2 id=h2>Activities</h2>
        <p id="p2">There were endless things to do in Valencia. A huge part of Valencia was enjoying the atmosphere or just stumbling upon something to do. Some of my favorite things to do were walking around the markets, eating at restaurants, and walking through the parks. One of my favorite activities was walking through Jardín del Turia. This is a park that runs nine kilometers through the city, where you will find skate parks, basketball courts, soccer fields, etc. Living in the heart of Valencia, I was minutes walk from many different restaurants, museums, stores, and historical sites. With a bit of a longer walk, bus, or taxi, I could be at the beach or the mall. There is something for everyone in Valencia, whether you enjoy social activities or just being in nature, the chill vibe is for everyone. </p>
<img src="/Applications/Museu.jpg" alt="City of Art and Sciences" class="center" width="650" height="400">
<p id="p3">This picture is from the City of Arts and Sciences. This is the museum of arts and sciences, which was actually really cool. I'm not a huge museum fan, but this one was fun. The architecture in Valencia is amazing and this is an example. This is also near the aquarium, which is the largest in Europe. The City of Arts and Sciences is also home to a great nightclub MYA where we spent some of our nights through the mornings. Typical nights out in Spain start at tapas in the afternoon/evening and end at 6-7 in the morning. It is definitely tiring, but so much fun! If you were to keep going past the City of Arts and Sciences you will end up at the beach!</p>	
<img src="/Applications/Market.jpg" alt="Mercat Central de València or The Central Market" class="center" width="650" height="400"> 
<p id="p4"> This next picture is from Mercat Central de València or the Central Market. I loved seeing all the different types of meats they had, since I wasn't familiar with all of them. A common meat they sell is Ibérico ham, which is a cured leg of pork. If you aren't a fan of ham you can also find all types of fruits, nuts, candies, and take-out food that is really good! This is a unique experience, and if you want another cultural experience I would recommend going to a flamenco show. I don't have any footage, but it is an intimate experience. It is typically in a small bar or cafe where they perform flamenco dance, which is really interesting.</p>

<div id="Food">
    <h2 id=h3>Food</h2>
    <p id="p5">Food is a huge part of the culture in Spain. Like I said earlier, eating at specific times is a also a huge part of the culture. The way a night out would typically go is that you go out to tapas, which is a snack or appetizer along with a drink. Many restaurants have tapas deals from late afternoon to the evening. Then an hour or two later you would head over to a restaurant where you would spend time until like 11 or 12 at night. Rushing is not a thing in Spain, so it is very nice being able to talk at a table for so long and just enjoy yourself. After that you head over to the bar until 2-3, where you finally make your way to the club. Eating and enjoying your meal is a huge deal and also it is rude to not finish your drink. </p>
<img src="Images/100 Montaditos.png" alt="100 Montaditos" class="center" width="550" height="350">

<p id="p6"> This picture of tapas is from 100 Montaditos. Montaditos translates "to mount", which is in reference to the different types of meats, cheeses, etc. in between the sandwich bread. I really loved this place because of the wide variety of items. It included 100 sandwiches, along with other tapas such as patatas bravas, croquettes, chicken nuggets, etc. Patatas bravas are potato cubes with a spicy brava sauce and sometimes with an aioli. You can see them in the top left of the picture. Croquettes are a mix of meats and potato to make a meat fritter. </p>

<img src="Images/Croissant & Spanish omelette.png" alt="Croissant and Spanish omelette" class="center" width="550" height="400">
<p id="p6"> In this picture we see a croissant sandwich with ham and cheese and a Spanish omelette or tortilla. This is one of the most popular dishes, made with potato, eggs, and onion. I thought I wouldn't like it that much because I am not a huge fan of onions, but they are delicious. Another huge staple that I don't have a picture of is paella. It is a traditional rice dish made with saffron, it is delicious! I recommend the chicken paella, but the traditional Valencia paella comes with rabbit which I have heard is pretty good! Sandwiches and bakery items are big in Europe, so in Valencia you can find great sandwiches practically anywhere, many with the ham that is so popular, but also many without.</p>

<div id="Art">
    <h2 id=h4>Art</h2>
    <p id="p7">There was a lot of art in Spain, but the art I am going to focus on is street art. I was never a huge street art fan until I studied in Valencia. I fell in love with David De Limon's artwork. It is very simple, yet satisfying. It feels like wherever you walk you can always find his artwork. This isn't the only street art or art in general, just my favorite. There is plenty of other art, I just think his is amazing.</p>
